#  MCP Server for Semantic Treehouse

## Overview

The goal of this project is to design and implement a first version of a MCP server that exposes resources from Semantic Treehouse (STH) to AI environments/ chatbots.

The MCP server will work as a bridge between
- the STH REST API (data models, code lists), and
- AI systems/ IDE assistants that consume these.

The focus will mainly be on read-only resources.

TBD.
